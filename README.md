# DEEL BACKEND TASK

 As I didn't have enough time to finish everything I wanted to, I'll explain what I would have liked to add to what is present in the project: 

- The try catch in the methods.
- An API template to load the Sequelize models, middlewares, Express routes, according to a specific API definition

Have a great day !
